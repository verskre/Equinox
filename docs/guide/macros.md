# Macros

<p>The macro system is a collection of controllers that output a signal. Macros can be programmed to modulate multiple effects and parameters simultaneously, on command.</p>

### Triggers

Triggers are macros that have an on/off state. There are two types of triggers: momentary and toggle.

### Knobs & Sliders

Knobs and sliders are used for fine control of parameters.

### Adding macro exports

To add a parameter for a macro to export to, drag the parameter onto the macro. The macro will export its signal to the parameter.

To configure a macro's exports, right-click on the macro and select 'View exports'. A window will open, showing all the macro's exports. You can enable, disable or delete them.

### Configuring macros

To configure macros, right-click on the macro and select 'Macro options'. This will bring up a menu of parameters for the macro.

#### Options

- __Name__ - Name of macro
- __Color__ - Adjust hue of macro
- __Min__ - Clamp min value
